What is Καιρος (Kairos)
---

Empire Builder - A game in which the player builds a large and expansive empire over the course of a relatively long play time. For our game, the player will build a large empire based in a medieval fantasy setting. They will have to compete with a number of other factions for resources and land, with the ultimate goal of being the most powerful nation on the continent. 

RTS - Real Time Strategy - A game which prioritizes fast pace action between opposing armies. The goal of our game is to create a place where players have to manage a large empire within the constraints of a constantly moving world. Some parts of the game rely on overarching empire strategy, but we also want to give the user an idea of Base building and unit micro management.

What makes Kairos different?
- An Expansive Real-time map
	- RTS games have a very limited map size. Our goal is to create a map that runs in real time but that’s more expansive than our RTS predecessors.
- Resources focused on expansion
	- Resource management will be one of our games major game mechanics. However, unlike many RTS games, we don't want our users to simply run out of resources. Instead, resource management will be focused on expanding. While your resources don’t run out, every unit and structure will passively consume upkeep resources. As a result, your army and base is directly linked to your resource collection. If you never expand, your resources will never run out, but you won't be able to grow either. 
- Strategy view
	- Players won't be able to micro-manage every aspect of their empire. As a result, we want players to have the chance to build empire scale strategies. This means that part of their empire will be managed and defended automatically without their direct control. (they can of course take direct control if needed)
- Politics
	- When dealing with other nations, there is inevitably going to be conflict, but not all conflict requires violence. Players will have the chance to build allyship with neighboring nations. This will enable trading of resources, and give you the chance to join battles as a team. You and your allies will have each other's backs

"The world doesn't stop for anyone"
---
In many strategy games, players get long pauses during which they can strategize and prepare for whatever problem they are facing. We want to give the player a much more high-stakes experience. Rather than allowing the player to pause and think, we want the player to feel the pressure of a real emperor. You can't always be there for every decision, and sometimes you have to rely on your people to defend themselves. The world of Kairos doesn't stop for anyone.
