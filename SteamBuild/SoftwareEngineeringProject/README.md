What is Καιρος (Kairos)
---

RTS - Real Time Strategy - A game which prioritizes fast pace action between opposing armies. The goal of our game is to create a place where players have to manage a large empire within the constraints of a constantly moving world. Some parts of the game rely on overarching empire strategy, but we also want to give the user an idea of Base building and unit micro management.
